    "## 1-1. pathlib Module\n",
    "The `pathlib` module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems. Path classes are divided between pure paths (`PurePosixPath` & `PureWindowsPath`), which provide purely computational operations without I/O, and concrete paths (`PosixPath` & `WindowsPath`), which inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations. Note that the special entries `.` and `..` are excluded from all returned pathnames in the `pathlib` module.\n",
    "1. `pathlib.Path`\n",
    "   - `stat(*, follow_symlinks=True)`\n",
    "   - `lstat()`: Returns the symbolic link's information rather than its target's if the path points to a symbolic link.\n",
    "   - `exists()`\n",
    "   - `is_file()`\n",
    "   - `is_dir()`\n",
    "   - `is_symlink()`\n",
    "3. `pathlib.Path.iterdir()`: Yields `Path` (`PosixPath` or `WindowsPath`) objects of the directory contents. \n",
    "4. `pathlib.Path.glob(pattern, *, case_sensitive=None)`: Globs the given relative `pattern` in the directory represented by this path, yielding all matching files.\n",
    "   - The addition of `**` means \"this directory and all subdirectoriesm recursively\". In other words, it enables recursive globbing.\n",
    "5. `pathlib.Path.rglob(pattern, *, case_sensitive=None)`: Globs the given relative pattern recursively like calling `pathlib.Path.glob()` with `**/` added in front of the pattern. \n",
    "6. `pathlib.Path.walk(top_down=True, on_error=None, follow_symlinks=False)`: Generates the filenames in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. Yields a 3-tuple of `(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)`.\n",
    "7. `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)`: Makes the path absolute, resolving any symbolic links. Returns a new `Path` object.\n",

      "India's Maruti sees profits jump India's biggest carmaker Maruti has reported a sharp increase in quarterly profit after a booming economy and low interest rates boosted demand. Net profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; £29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier. Total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. Maruti accounts for half of India's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles. Demand in India also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. Figures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. Maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. The company, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. Sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. Maruti is not the only company benefiting as Indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. Utility vehicle and tractor maker Mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. Profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.\n",

    "## 7-6. Stop Word Removal\n",
    "- Stop words are commonly used words in language, adding little to no value to the meaning of the sentence. A group of words that do not add any additional information such as articles, determiners and prepositions are associated with stop words.\n",
    "- The list of stop words vary from package to package.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `nltk.corpus.stopwords`\n",
    "2. `spacy`: Uses `Token.is_stop` attribute.\n",
    "3. `gensim.parsing.preprocessing.remove_stopwords()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Stop Words:\n",
    "1. **Common Stop Words:** These are the most frequently occurring words in a language and are often removed during text preprocessing. Examples include “the,” “is,” “in,” “for,” “where,” “when,” “to,” “at,” etc.\n",
    "2. **Custom Stop Words:** Depending on the specific task or domain, additional words may be considered as stopwords. These could be domain-specific terms that don’t contribute much to the overall meaning. For example, in a medical context, words like “patient” or “treatment” might be considered as custom stopwords.\n",
    "3. **Numerical Stop Words:** Numbers and numeric characters may be treated as stopwords in certain cases, especially when the analysis is focused on the meaning of the text rather than specific numerical values. As the number removal section.\n",
    "4. **Single-Character Stop Words:** Single characters, such as “a,” “I,” “s,” or “x,” may be considered stopwords, particularly in cases where they don’t convey much meaning on their own. Regular expression to find all single character: `\\b[a-zA-Z]\\s`. Note \"a\" will be removed.\n",
    "5. **Contextual Stop Words:** Words that are stopwords in one context but meaningful in another may be considered as contextual stopwords. For instance, the word “will” might be a stopword in the context of general language processing but could be important in predicting future events."
