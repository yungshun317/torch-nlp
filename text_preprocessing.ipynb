    "## 1-1. pathlib Module\n",
    "The `pathlib` module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems. Path classes are divided between pure paths (`PurePosixPath` & `PureWindowsPath`), which provide purely computational operations without I/O, and concrete paths (`PosixPath` & `WindowsPath`), which inherit from pure paths but also provide I/O operations. Note that the special entries `.` and `..` are excluded from all returned pathnames in the `pathlib` module.\n",
    "1. `pathlib.Path`\n",
    "   - `stat(*, follow_symlinks=True)`\n",
    "   - `lstat()`: Returns the symbolic link's information rather than its target's if the path points to a symbolic link.\n",
    "   - `exists()`\n",
    "   - `is_file()`\n",
    "   - `is_dir()`\n",
    "   - `is_symlink()`\n",
    "3. `pathlib.Path.iterdir()`: Yields `Path` (`PosixPath` or `WindowsPath`) objects of the directory contents. \n",
    "4. `pathlib.Path.glob(pattern, *, case_sensitive=None)`: Globs the given relative `pattern` in the directory represented by this path, yielding all matching files.\n",
    "   - The addition of `**` means \"this directory and all subdirectoriesm recursively\". In other words, it enables recursive globbing.\n",
    "5. `pathlib.Path.rglob(pattern, *, case_sensitive=None)`: Globs the given relative pattern recursively like calling `pathlib.Path.glob()` with `**/` added in front of the pattern. \n",
    "6. `pathlib.Path.walk(top_down=True, on_error=None, follow_symlinks=False)`: Generates the filenames in a directory tree by walking the tree either top-down or bottom-up. Yields a 3-tuple of `(dirpath, dirnames, filenames)`.\n",
    "7. `pathlib.Path.resolve(strict=False)`: Makes the path absolute, resolving any symbolic links. Returns a new `Path` object.\n",

      "Iran budget seeks state sell-offs\n",
      "\n",
      "Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, has unveiled a budget designed to expand public spending by 30% but loosen the Islamic republic's dependence on oil.\n",
      "\n",
      "The budget for the fiscal year starting on 21 March calls for the sell-off of 20% of the state's corporate holdings. Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget. But opposition from members of parliament who have attacked previous privatisations could block his plans. Elections in May 2004 ousted many of Mr Khatami's supporters in parliament in favour of more hard-line religious conservatives. Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment. The ruling was a response to the involvement in telecoms and airport projects by Turkish companies, which hardliners accused of doing business with Israel. It came not long after the Expediency Council - Iran's ultimate decision-maker - blessed Mr Khatami's policy of selling stakes in sectors protected by the constitution such as energy, transport, telecoms and banking. Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year. He said he wanted to increase the 2005-6 budget to 1,546 trillion rials ($175.6bn; £93.6bn) from the previous year's 1,070 trillion. Within that figure, taxation would rise to $14.3bn, a rise of over 40% from what is expected from the current year. In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005. \"Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues,\" Mr Khatami said. \"Oil revenues should be used for productive investment.\" Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.\n",

    "## 7-6. Stop Word Removal\n",
    "- Stop words are commonly used words in language, adding little to no value to the meaning of the sentence. A group of words that do not add any additional information such as articles, determiners and prepositions are associated with stop words.\n",
    "- The list of stop words vary from package to package.\n",

    "1. `nltk.corpus.stopwords`\n",
    "2. `spacy`: Uses the `Token.is_stop` attribute.\n",
    "4. `gensim.parsing.preprocessing.remove_stopwords()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Stop Words:\n",
    "1. **Common Stop Words:** These are the most frequently occurring words in a language and are often removed during text preprocessing. Examples include “the,” “is,” “in,” “for,” “where,” “when,” “to,” “at,” etc.\n",
    "2. **Custom Stop Words:** Depending on the specific task or domain, additional words may be considered as stopwords. These could be domain-specific terms that don’t contribute much to the overall meaning. For example, in a medical context, words like “patient” or “treatment” might be considered as custom stopwords.\n",
    "3. **Numerical Stop Words:** Numbers and numeric characters may be treated as stopwords in certain cases, especially when the analysis is focused on the meaning of the text rather than specific numerical values. As the number removal section.\n",
    "4. **Single-Character Stop Words:** Single characters, such as “a,” “I,” “s,” or “x,” may be considered stopwords, particularly in cases where they don’t convey much meaning on their own. Regular expression to find all single character: `\\b[a-zA-Z]\\s`. Note \"a\" will be removed.\n",
    "5. **Contextual Stop Words:** Words that are stopwords in one context but meaningful in another may be considered as contextual stopwords. For instance, the word “will” might be a stopword in the context of general language processing but could be important in predicting future events."
